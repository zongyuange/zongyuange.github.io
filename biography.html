<p id="bk-color">Associate Professor Zongyuan Ge conducts interdisciplinary research at the boundary between artificial intelligence, computer-aided diagnosis, biomedical engineering, medical imaging and machine learning and is multi-award winning medical information science and technology entrepreneur. His research leverages cutting-edge AI technologies using large-scale multi-modality medical data including imaging, medical records, gene data and models the clinicians’ medical knowledge underlying tasks like diagnosis and prognosis for eye (ophthalmology), skin (dermatology), heart (cardiovascular) and neurodegeneration diseases. He is also one of Australia’s most in-demand experts in technologies including medical robotics and artificial intelligence, and is a passionate science communicator. He currently holds the position of Associate Professor at the Monash University Vice-Chancellor and Provost Office as well as Faculty of Engineering, Research Affiliate at the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision, NVIDIA AI Fellow, the Chief Scientist at Monash-Airdoc Research Centre and Chief Research Officer at Eyetelligence. He is the founder and director of the Monash Medical AI group (https://www.monash.edu/mmai-group) with over fully-funded 16+ PhD students, 4 Research fellows, and 10+ Research Master/FYP students.</p>

<p>His research has helped attracted more than 15 million dollars in research and industry funding for fellowships and grants from organisations including the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF), The Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) and NVIDIA. Zongyuan’s research papers have been published in top-tier journals and conferences such as The British Medical Journal, BMC Bioinformatics, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, NeurIPS, CVPR, KDD, AAAI and MICCAI. His citations h-index is 21, with 2700+ citations only three years post PhD (2017). </p>


<p id="bk-color">He has led and contributed to six international research projects in the areas of dermatology, ophthalmology, radiology and neurology with major industry companies like IBM Watson Health, medical technology unicorn company Airdoc and medical service provider Molemap. These findings have been translated into health products and services for clients such as Specsavers and BUPA. His work has been recognised by many international and national awards including the 200 Most Qualified Young Researchers in Computer and Mathematics by the Scientific Committee of the Heidelberg Laureate Foundation, IBM Scientific Research Accomplishment Award, IBM Manager Choice Award and Monash Exceptional Achievement Award. </p>

<p>His industry expertise developed in IBM and NVIDIA has helped his collaborators to define the prototype of the machine learning algorithm for the healthcare data platform. His role with Monash eResearch and data science & AI platform provides Monash researchers and their collaborators with the ability to access to several High-Performance Computing facilities and data science services. This includes the Monash-hosted national specialised data-processing facility for medical imaging and visualisation.</p>
